Fake News Detection

This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It aims to help users differentiate between real and misleading news based on text analysis.

Features

Text Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes news articles
Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest
Deep Learning Model: LSTM-based neural network for better accuracy
Word Embeddings: Uses pre-trained word embeddings for improved understanding
Model Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score analysis
Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled news articles with:

Title: The headline of the news article
Text: The main body of the article
Label: 1 for real news, 0 for fake news
